### 'Make ~~America~~ The Internet ~~great~~ *fun* again!'

Steadily working towards a highly configurable suite of interactive experiences. 

# this project

Stack: 
* Javascript
* Redux
* GraphQL
* ThreeJS
* GLSL
* AWS: CloudFormation:
  * Code Pipeline
  * Code Build
  * Cloud Front
  * S3 Bucket

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Here's a quick and dirty method for [provisioning your AWS resources](https://medium.com/@jeffreyrussom/react-continuous-deployments-with-aws-codepipeline-f5034129ff0e) and setting up a CD pipeline.

### I am a 

New experimental resume which explores the capability of modern web technologies. Some of the effects may be a little heavy.

This is by no means a finished result. You'll probably come across things that'll make you scratch your butt.

# todo

If ever I get the time, I'd like to:

1. Refactor code:
    1. Named @ directives for imports:
    2. Refactor schema: lined with AWS bloat as of right now
    3. Error handling: implement React Error boundaries.
2. Create a test suite comprising: unit tests (jest), integration (enzyme), e2e (tba)
3. Create style (dat.gui) presets:
    1. 001 - Hot Fudge (Purple, Dark Brown) - Scent (Dark Chocolate)
    2. 002 - Blue Midnight (Gold, Royal Blue) - Scent (Fresh, Light-Spice, Royal)
    3. 003 - Suave (Tan, Red) - Scent (Leather, All-Spice)
    4. 004 - Black on Black (Black, SpotGloss Black) - Scent (Spice, Deep, Woody) 
    5. 005 - Salmon
4. Introduce some sort of loader, possibly using: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading
5. Potential background inspiration: https://codepen.io/usefulthink/pen/YNrvpY
6. Attraction Effect: On hover of duties, they attract the skills with the most relevance. Possibly an extension to the particleAttraction effect, replace bodies with text sprites.
7. Implement that PlayCanvas envmap sweaty metal effect!
8. Card shaders: Didn’t have enough time to properly implement, but could prove to yield some interests results.
9. 'I was built using’ component. To showcase stack of technologies used. 
10. Implement better mobile responsive styles.

# future features

1. Ability to click any one html element and have it convert into a textbox. You can then enquire about the ‘contents’ of that particular element. 
2. Consider redundancies: pushing to both GitHub and AWS Commit
3. Separate repo for effects: code other people can use.
4. Mobile device experience and effects: TBA
5. A page that evolves every 20 or so seconds, into a different preset. Nice way to showcase the diversity of effects and keep things interesting.
6. A bunch of onMouseOver funnies, such as text changing to funny layman speak.
7. A animation stop button could possibly prove helpful.
8. Timeline scroller, something that represents the same concept found in my PDF resume.
9. Revolving/Organic Hamada Logo (inspired by Al Jazeera logo sting)
10. Possibly introduce a Chatbox? 
11. Quick contact feature: Implemented as a floating (physics-driven) circle that you can click anytime to grow, and write message within.
12. Possibly make verticalLightening react to mouse: though not sure in what manner atm.
13. DeepDive section: not one for verbosity, but I guess jargon matters to some. So possibly create a ‘DeepDive’ effect which expands each duty to reveal a long written description of that duty. 
14. Mascot: I’ve always wanted this! Some sort of mascot that interacts with the user in funny ways and makes funny comments  (which appear in dialogue bubbles) given where the user hovers over.
15. Shadow Map Effect: shadows cast onto document from off-screen objects to create interesting, evolving patterns, inspired by: https://threejs.org/examples/?q=shadow#webgl_shadowmap_pointlight
